    <h2>Last Updated: November 11, 2025</h2>
    
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Kibbe ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>
    
    <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Photos and Images:</strong> We process photos you upload or capture through the app to analyze body structure and provide Kibbe body type recommendations. All processing is done locally on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Face Data via TrueDepth API:</strong> When you use the face analysis feature, our app uses Apple's TrueDepth API (ARKit Face Tracking) to collect facial geometry data, including facial landmarks, measurements, and 3D facial structure information. <strong>This data is processed entirely on your device and is never transmitted to our servers or shared with third parties.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>App Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymous usage statistics to improve our services.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Basic device information may be collected for app functionality and troubleshooting.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide body type analysis and style recommendations</li>
        <li>To analyze facial features using TrueDepth API for Kibbe body type analysis (all processing occurs locally on your device)</li>
        <li>To improve our app's features and user experience</li>
        <li>To provide customer support</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>TrueDepth API and Face Data</h3>
    <p><strong>What information is collected using TrueDepth API?</strong></p>
    <p>Our app uses Apple's TrueDepth API (ARKit Face Tracking) to collect the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Facial geometry data (3D facial structure)</li>
        <li>Facial landmarks and measurements</li>
        <li>Facial feature positions and proportions</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>For what purposes is this information collected?</strong></p>
    <p>The face data collected via TrueDepth API is used exclusively for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Analyzing facial features to provide Kibbe body type analysis</li>
        <li>Calculating facial measurements and proportions for style recommendations</li>
        <li>Providing personalized style guidance based on facial structure</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Will the data be shared with any third parties? Where will this information be stored?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>NO. The face data collected via TrueDepth API is NEVER shared with any third parties.</strong> All face data is processed entirely on your device using Apple's ARKit framework. <strong>We do not transmit, store, or share any face data on our servers or with any external services.</strong> The data exists only temporarily in your device's memory during the analysis process and is immediately discarded after the analysis is complete.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Data Retention:</strong> Face data is not stored permanently. It is processed in real-time on your device and discarded immediately after analysis. No face data is retained on your device or transmitted to our servers.</p>
    
    <h3>Data Storage and Security</h3>
    <p><strong>All data processing occurs locally on your device.</strong> Your photos, face data, and personal information are processed entirely on your device using Apple's Vision Framework and ARKit. <strong>We do not store your photos, face data, or personal information on our servers.</strong> All analysis is performed on-device, ensuring your privacy and data security.</p>
    
    <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>We may use third-party services for analytics and app functionality. These services have their own privacy policies. <strong>Importantly, face data collected via TrueDepth API is never shared with any third-party services.</strong></p>
    
    <h3>Your Rights</h3>
    <p>You have the right to access, modify, or delete your personal information. You can do this through the app settings or by contacting us. Since all face data is processed locally and not stored, you can stop using the face analysis feature at any time, and no face data will be collected.</p>
