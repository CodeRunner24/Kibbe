    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    
    <h4>How does Kibbe analyze my body type?</h4>
    <p>Kibbe uses Apple's Vision Framework to analyze key body points from your photos. The app calculates various body ratios and compares them against the Kibbe Body Type system to provide personalized recommendations.</p>
    
    <h4>Are my photos stored or shared?</h4>
    <p>No. All photo processing happens locally on your device. We do not store, upload, or share your photos with any servers or third parties.</p>
    
    <h4>How accurate are the results?</h4>
    <p>The analysis is based on algorithmic calculations of body proportions. For best results, use clear, full-body photos taken in good lighting. Results are provided for informational purposes.</p>
    
    <h4>Can I use photos from my gallery?</h4>
    <p>Yes! You can either take a new photo with the camera or select an existing photo from your photo library.</p>
